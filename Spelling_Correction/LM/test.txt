FED DATA PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE TIGHTER POLICY U.S. banking data released today distorted draw sweeping conclusions monetary policy , support market 's assumption Federal Reserve started tighten grip credit , economists said .
`` 's clear Fed firmed somewhat .
Discount window borrowings , net free reserves , Fed funds rate average pattern reserve additions consistent modest tightening , '' said Dana Johnson First Chicago Corp. Johnson , several economists , estimate Fed funds rate trade 6-1/4 6-3/8 pct .
Discount window borrowings week Wednesday 935 mln dlrs day , producing daily average two-week statement period 689 mln dlrs , highest since week December 31 , 1986 , 393 mln dlrs previously .
Moreover , banks forced borrow huge 5.2 billion dlrs Fed Wednesday - highest daily total year - even though unexpectedly low Treasury balances Fed day left banks two billion dlrs reserves Fed anticipated .
However , economists said almost certain Fed aiming much lower discount window borrowings witnessed week .
pointed two factors may forced banks scramble reserves end week .
First , economists expect M-1 money supply week ended April 29 rise staggering 15 20 billion dlrs , partly reflecting parking checking accounts proceeds stock market sales mutual fund redemptions pay annual income taxes .
banks ' checking-account liabilities rise , reserves required hold deposit Fed .
Required reserves indeed rise sharply 2.5 billion dlrs day two weeks ended Wednesday , economists said Fed may believed magnitude projected M-1 surge late week started add reserves late .
Second , apparent shortage Treasury bills apparently left Wall Street dealers little collateral enagage repurchase agreements Fed , economists said .
Thus , although 10.3 billion dlrs repos outstanding Wednesday night , Fed may wanted add even reserves prevented .
`` 's inconceivable Fed n't add much wanted shortage collateral , '' said Ward McCarthy Merrill Lynch Economics Inc. McCarthy estimated Fed targetting discount-window borrowings 400 mln dlrs day , equivalent Fed funds rate around 6-3/8 pct .
citing reasons Fed probably tightened credit degree suggested data , economists said fact Fed delayed arranging overnight injections reserves last day statement period good sign restrictive policy .
Jeffrey Leeds Chemical Bank convinced Fed tightening policy .
reviewing today's figures , said , `` 's fair say Fed may moving toward slightly less accommodative reserve posture . ''
Leeds expects Fed funds trade 6-1/4 6-3/8 pct said Fed unlikely raise discount rate unless dollar 's fall gathers pace .
Johnson First Chicago agreed , citing political opposition Washington dollar-defense package time Congress sees dollar depreciation key reducing U.S. trade surplus Japan .

DUTCH OFFICIAL RATE CUT SEEN STILL LIKELY cut half percentage point Dutch official interest rates still prospect , although economists said timing would depend Bundesbank moves .
Speculation rife Dutch Central Bank , encouraged strong guilder/mark relationship wide premiums Dutch money capital market rates German , might lower rates without Bundesbank moving first .
Last month , Central Bank lowered special advances rate 5.1 pct 5.25 pct Bundesbank dropped repurchase tender rate 3.55 pct 3.8 pct .
rate remained force , holding five pct official secured loans rate governs commercial bank borrowings .
Given strong guilder , fall West German repo rate would trigger lower special advances tariff , forcing official Dutch rate cut , analysts said .
February , Bundesbank cut discount rate three pct 3.5 pct , Central Bank lowered money market rates removed surcharge secured loans rate lending three month credit quota .
Since , however , Central Bank Finance Ministry made clear favour lower official rates .
April , Central Bank President Wim Duisenberg said would follow Bundesbank cut , last week Finance Ministry expressed satisfaction raised 2.25 billion guilders six pct coupon state loan priced 100.10 pct effective yield 5.98 pct , lowest since 1965 .
Technically , analysts said , difference secured loans rate applies lending credit quota , tariff special advances add extra liquidity money market .
Bank economists dealers said West German move lower rate securities repurchase pacts would result Central Bank easing special advance rate , provided guilder/mark relationship permitted .
Central Bank aims keep guilder stable around parity value within European Monetary System 112.673 guilders per 100 marks .
Today , foreign exchange buying pushed mark 10 guilder cents 112.705 guilders per 100 fix , level would permit change interest rate differential West Germany Netherlands , dealers said .
economist ABN Bank said expected West German Dutch interest rates ease short term .
However , said new wage agreements West Germany raised inflation expectations would put upward pressure interest rates longer term .
Netherlands , inflation outlook 1987 nil , even negative , latest official economic forecasts point falling rate economic growth .
`` depend outcome collective wage agreement negotiations whether could cost push inflation , '' ABN economist said .
said Dutch money supply growth , ran 3.4 pct January , could also contribute inflation .
Amro Bank , leading analyst said inflation could run two pct next year .
bank expects Dutch capital market rates , currently averaging around 6.1 pct , stop easing second half year stabilize around 5.6 pct .
Analysts said official rate cut could trigger buying spree bond market would bring yields , probably temporarily , money rates could fall five pct .
Currently , periods traded 5.12 5.25 pct money market .

House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza said committee consider Glickman proposal .

Iran , Libya Saudi Arabia among also saw sales problems earlier year , traders say .

Industry estimates vary proportion OPEC oil exports actually sold official prices .
Several experts say one-quarter one-third total fact sells official prices , rest included processing barter deals sold form refined products .
Problems new structure appeared earlier year , producers ' output fell due customer reluctance pay new prices .
Nigeria especially found gasoline-rich Bonny Light crude -- OPEC 's highest priced grade 18.92 dlrs barrel -- uncompetitive spot market Britain 's Brent .
February March , Nigeria 's production shrank 1.238 mln bpd OPEC quota .
Spot prices since revived , due partly seasonal demand gasoline , output risen .
